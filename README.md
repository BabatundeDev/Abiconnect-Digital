## Key Features
 
**Scroll Reveal Animations** — Every page uses a custom `useScrollReveal` hook built on the native `IntersectionObserver` API (no external library). Elements animate in with directional transitions (up, left, right) and staggered delays as the user scrolls.
 
**Smooth Transitions** — All interactive elements include hover transitions: card lifts, icon animations, button glow effects, and animated underlines on links.
 
**ScrollToTop on Navigation** — A `ScrollToTop` component resets the scroll position to the top on every route change, ensuring a clean page experience.
 
**SPA Routing Fix** — A `vercel.json` rewrite rule ensures all routes resolve correctly on refresh and direct URL access, preventing 404 errors in production.
